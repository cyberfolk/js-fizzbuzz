# Fizzbuzz

**Initial commit**: 10/03/23

**Tecnologie:** Javascript, HTML, CSS e Bootstrap.

**Info**:üß® Here is Fizzbuzz, a classic, also made for Boolean
First, a grid numbered from 1 to 100 numbers is generated, after which the user must set the "Fizz" number and the "Buzz" number, using the appropriate inputs. Once you press enter, all the multiple cells of the "Fizz" number will be filled with the word "Fizz", the same goes for the multiples of the "Buzz" number. If a number is a multiple of both the "Fizz" number and the "Buzz" number, the writing "FizzBuzz" will be displayed in its cell.

## Milestone

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 in the console but that:
   - for multiples of 3 molds ‚ÄúFizz‚Äù instead of the number
   - for multiples of 5 ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù molds
   - for numbers that are both multiples of 3 and 5, ‚ÄúFizzBuzz‚Äù prints.
- Create a container in the DOM, adding an HTML element with the correct number or string to display.
- Apply different styles to elements added to the DOM in _BONUS 1_, depending on whether the value entered is a number, a fizz, a buzz, or a fizzbuzz.
- Create a form with which you can change the numerical bases of the "fizz" and the "buzz"
